              <hr>
              <p class="about-text"> I have been working as qualified personal trainer for the last 10 years. In that time, I have continuously pushed myself to develop. I am committed to improving myself and my knowledge for my clients. As a trainer, I work with my clients to find what works best for them. This means working out a training and nutrition schedule that lends itself to their current lifestyle and not enforcing one. Listening and adapting to each clients enables me to give a truely personalised experience to each individual. Having worked in the fitness industry for this length of time, I have seen plenty of trends come and go. However, one thing has remained the same, consistency pays off! </p>

              <h4>Continuous Professional Development:</h4>
              <hr>
              <p class="about-text"> I attend as many training courses as possible on topics including hypertrophy, female specific training and sport specific training. I have also completed formal training with a masters in nutrition and training from NUI Galway in 2015. While looking for a new challenge after my masters, I took up golf myself in 2016. Seeing the demands that the sport places on the body, I gained <a href="https://www.mytpi.com/certification" class="text-highlight-link">TPI</a>&reg; level 3 qualification. I've used this to deliver seminars and promote mobility in all my clients. </p>

              <hr>
              <p class="about-text"> Prior to becoming a personal trainer, I worked as a Radiation Therapist. Although I loved my job, I wanted to see if I could help people in a different way. Instead of being part of the cure, maybe I could be part of the prevention? </p>
